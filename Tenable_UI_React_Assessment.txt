Tenable - Nessus UI Assessment

1) A server sends the following data when requesting 'http://[yourserver]/download/request?host=2'  :

{
"configurations" : [
     {
        "name" : "host1",
        "hostname" : "nessus-ntp.lab.com",
        "port" : 1241,
        "username" : "toto"
     },
     {
        "name" : "host2",
        "hostname" : "nessus-xml.lab.com",
        "port" : 3384,
        "username" : "admin"
     }
 ]
}

Write an HTML/JS code to send this request and display the result.

2) Use jQuery to add some style and design to the previous code.

3) Add some CSS design/style

4) Use the React framework and any additonal JavaScript libraries in the React ecosystem that you want and/or like to show us your skills on this small web application.

5) instead of sending host=2 you now send host=10000 and the response contains 10000 fields. How would you handle that? What could be improved to get the best performance?
